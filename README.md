# LittleBabyTwitterBot
This is a Twitter bot that accesses the Twitter API through a Twitter account/app called @LittleBabyDylan. 

@LittleBayDylan uses LittleBabyTwitterBot to take new tweets that my friend Dylan publishes, replace all the R's and L's with W's, and then reply to his tweet with this new baby-speak version.

LittleBabyTwitterBot checks for new tweets every 20 minutes, to account for both his tweeting frequency and to make the response time totally random giving the impression that it isn't a bot, but a person manually writing it out and responding to each tweet. At the time of writing this, it's been running for 5 months and has responded to 210 tweets and he still thinks it's a person - as seen below.

Is this mean? Maybe. Is it funny? Absolutely.
